Slide 1:

In the test, we create N projects and each of them has a build config. Then we trigger all builds simultaneously with M iterations.

For OCP 4.1, we reached the number of project up to 2000.

During the test, we mnonitor the successful rate of builds and the number of concurrent running builds.

Here is the observation:
Almost all builds succeeded.
Average build time is slower and average push time is a bit faster. Here is a sample for 500 projects.

We also found the number of concurrent builds in the cluster is throttled, which is also new on OCP 4.
This build is verified with a smaller cluster and we will rerun the test in the next round to verify it in scale cluster.
